## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Shankar, a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable systems. Previously at JP Morgan Chase, I worked on high-performance trading systems and developed real-time analytics tools. I love solving complex challenges and making systems more efficient!

When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m diving into sci-fi books, exploring new tech, or enjoying a good cup of coffee â˜•. Iâ€™m always up for a chat or collaboration â€“ feel free to connect!
